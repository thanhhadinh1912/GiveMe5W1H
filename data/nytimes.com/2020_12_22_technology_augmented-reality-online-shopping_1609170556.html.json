Shoes materialize. He turns his feet from side to side. How does the shoe look on his foot? How does the top of the sneaker meet the cuff of his pants leg?\n“It’s one thing when a shoe looks great on display,” Mr. Chen said. “When it’s on your foot, it’s just different.”\nMr. Chen, who has founded start-ups focused on gaming and augmented reality, is one of a growing number of consumers who, stuck at home because of the pandemic, are shopping in augmented reality.\nThe technology was made ubiquitous by the social media platform Snapchat, which used it to transform users’ faces into anime illustrations and add dancing hot dogs to their videos.

It displays goods as a filter on what they see on their phones, stitching shoes onto customers’ feet, adding makeup to their faces and dropping furniture into their apartments.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/technology/augmented-reality-online-shopping.html"}
