She was 95.\nHer son, Peter Wydler, said the cause was lung cancer.\nThe sound of conga drums reverberated at Ms. Dallas’s studio in Basel, Switzerland, for years as she gyrated to their rhythm. Her students watched reverently, eager to learn from a woman who had learned from Dunham, the matriarch of Black dance, who died in 2006.\n“I had three mothers in my life,” Ms. Dallas said in a 2016 documentary film about her, “What Is Luck?” “My mother, my grandmother and my godmother. And then I had Katherine Dunham. My professor.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/dance/othella-dallas-dead.html"}
