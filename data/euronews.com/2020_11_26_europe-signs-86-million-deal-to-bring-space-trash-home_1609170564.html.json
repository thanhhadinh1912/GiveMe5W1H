Several teams are working on ways to tackle the problem.\nThe object being removed from orbit is a so-called Vespa payload adapter that was used to hold and then release a satellite in 2013. It weighs about 112 kilograms.", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2020/11/26/europe-signs-86-million-deal-to-bring-space-trash-home"}
